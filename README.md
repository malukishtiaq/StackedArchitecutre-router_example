# new_architecture

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project has working example of stacked architecture. I just downloded the project and built on android. There were issues in it and was not launching on android. So I just fix those issue which were related to build gradle and android manifest. Also I made a change in gradle properties file too. And then I was able to launch the project. I commited the code in order to help others.
